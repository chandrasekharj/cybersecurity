* **Key Focus:**

Managing personally identifiable information (PII)
Compliance with privacy regulations
Privacy risk assessment and treatment
Application: Helps organizations integrate privacy into their information security management system and comply with global privacy laws.

<b>8. ISO/IEC 27019: Information Security Controls for the Energy Industry </b>

* **Overview:** This standard provides guidance on information security management for process control systems in the energy industry. It supplements ISO/IEC 27002 by focusing on the specific needs of energy infrastructure, such as power plants and smart grids.

* **Key Focus:**

Securing critical energy infrastructure
Cybersecurity controls specific to industrial control systems (ICS)
Application: Helps energy organizations protect critical infrastructure and manage cyber risks in operational technologies (OT).

<b>9. ISO/IEC 22301: Business Continuity Management Systems (BCMS) </b>

* **Overview:** ISO/IEC 22301 focuses on business continuity management, ensuring that organizations can continue operating during disruptions such as cyberattacks or other emergencies.

* **Key Focus:**

Business continuity planning and risk management
Disaster recovery and maintaining operational resilience
Application: Often used alongside ISO/IEC 27001 to ensure that cybersecurity incidents do not disrupt business operations.

<b>10. ISO/IEC 15408: Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation (CC) </b>

* **Overview:** Also known as the "Common Criteria," this standard provides a framework for evaluating the security properties of IT products and systems. It defines functional and assurance requirements for security evaluation.

* **Key Focus:**

Security evaluation of hardware and software systems
Assurance levels for IT security
Application: Widely used for evaluating the security of IT products, especially in government and defense sectors.

<b>11. ISO/IEC 27033: Network Security </b>
