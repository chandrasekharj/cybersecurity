Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Here are some common methods through which social engineering attacks can take place:

<b> Phishing: </b>

* **Email Phishing:** Attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate sources, such as banks or service providers. These emails often contain links to fake websites designed to steal login credentials or other sensitive information.
* **Spear Phishing:** This is a more targeted form of phishing where attackers tailor their messages to a specific individual or organization using personalized information gathered through OSINT.
* **Smishing (SMS Phishing):** Attackers send deceptive text messages that contain links or requests for sensitive information, such as one-time passcodes or account details.

<b> Pretexting: </b>

* **Impersonation:** Attackers create a fabricated scenario or pretext to obtain information from the target. For example, they might impersonate a company executive or IT support staff to convince an employee to reveal login credentials or perform actions that compromise security.
* **Fake Surveys:** Attackers pose as researchers or surveyors and request personal information under the guise of conducting a survey.

<b> Vishing (Voice Phishing): </b>

* **Telephone Scams:** Attackers use phone calls to impersonate trusted entities, such as financial institutions or tech support, to convince individuals to disclose sensitive information or perform security-related actions.
* **Robocalls:** Automated phone calls deliver pre-recorded messages designed to trick targets into providing personal information or pressing buttons that lead to further scams.

<b> Baiting: </b>

* **Physical Baiting:** Attackers leave malicious USB drives or other devices in public places, hoping that someone will connect them to their computer, thereby installing malware or providing access to the attacker.
* **Digital Baiting:** Attackers use enticing offers or incentives, such as free downloads or exclusive content, to lure targets into downloading malicious software or disclosing personal information.

<b> Tailgating: </b>

* **Physical Access:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to secure areas by following authorized personnel through entry points, such as using social engineering to ask for someoneâ€™s access card or code, or by posing as a delivery person.

<b> Impersonation: </b>

* **Role Play:** Attackers might pose as company employees, contractors, or visitors to gain access to restricted areas or obtain sensitive information. This can include dressing in uniforms or using fake credentials to appear legitimate.

<b> Quizzes and Social Media Manipulation: </b>

* **Quiz Scams:** Attackers create online quizzes or games designed to gather personal information from users, which can then be used for identity theft or other malicious purposes.
* **Social Media Fishing:** Attackers monitor social media profiles to gather personal details that can be used to craft convincing social engineering attacks or gain access to personal accounts.

<b> Credential Harvesting: </b>

* **Fake Login Pages:** Attackers create imitation login pages for popular websites and trick users into entering their credentials. These credentials are then captured by the attackers for unauthorized access.

<b> Pharming: </b>

* **DNS Spoofing:** Attackers manipulate DNS records to redirect users to fake websites that appear legitimate, where they may be tricked into providing sensitive information.

<b> Business Email Compromise (BEC): </b>

* **Spoofing:** Attackers use email spoofing techniques to impersonate high-level executives or trusted partners and send fraudulent instructions to employees, such as requests for wire transfers or confidential information.

<b> Quizzes and Contests: </b>

* **Fake Contests:** Attackers run fake contests or sweepstakes to collect personal details from participants, which can then be used for identity theft or targeted attacks.

Social engineering attacks often rely on exploiting human trust and psychological tendencies, making awareness and vigilance crucial in defending against these threats.
