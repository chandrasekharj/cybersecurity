Threat modeling is a systematic approach to identifying, understanding, and mitigating security risks in systems or applications. Different threat models focus on various aspects of security, depending on the organization's needs, the system's architecture, and the types of threats being analyzed. Below is a description of a range of threat models commonly used in cybersecurity:

<b> 1. STRIDE Threat Model </b>
* **Overview:** Developed by Microsoft, STRIDE is an acronym that represents six categories of security threats: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
* **Application:** STRIDE is often used during the design phase of software development to identify and mitigate potential threats.
* **Threat Categories:**
* **Spoofing:** Impersonating another entity (e.g., using stolen credentials).
* **Tampering:** Unauthorized alteration of data or code (e.g., modifying a configuration file).
* **Repudiation:** Denying actions without proof (e.g., a user denying they performed a specific action).
* **Information Disclosure:** Exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users (e.g., data breaches).
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting service availability (e.g., DDoS attacks).
* **Elevation of Privilege:** Gaining unauthorized access to higher levels of privilege (e.g., exploiting a vulnerability to gain admin access).
* **Use Case:** STRIDE is widely used in software development and system design to systematically identify and address potential security risks.

<b> 2. DREAD Threat Model </b>
* **Overview:** DREAD is a risk assessment model that evaluates threats based on five factors: Damage Potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability.
* **Application:** It helps prioritize threats by calculating a risk score for each potential vulnerability.
* **Threat Factors:**
* **Damage Potential:** The impact of the threat if exploited.
* **Reproducibility:** The ease with which the threat can be reproduced.
* **Exploitability:** The difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability.
* **Affected Users:** The number of users affected if the threat is realized.
* **Discoverability:** The likelihood of discovering the threat.
* **Use Case:** DREAD is often used in conjunction with STRIDE or other models to prioritize risks and allocate resources effectively based on the calculated risk scores.

<b> 3. PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) </b>
* **Overview:** PASTA is a risk-centric threat modeling framework that aims to align business objectives with technical security requirements. It consists of seven stages that guide the analysis from business impact assessment to technical analysis and threat identification.
* **Application:** PASTA is particularly suited for complex systems where aligning business risks with technical threats is crucial.
* **Stages:**
* **Stage 1:** Define business objectives.
* **Stage 2:** Define the technical scope.
* **Stage 3:** Decompose the application.
* **Stage 4:** Analyze threat intelligence.
* **Stage 5:** Model attack scenarios.
* **Stage 6:** Perform risk analysis and assessment.
* **Stage 7:** Define security requirements and mitigation strategies.
* **Use Case:** PASTA is often used in large organizations that need a comprehensive approach to threat modeling, particularly where business impact needs to be closely linked with security measures.

<b> 4. LINDDUN (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of information, Unawareness, Non-compliance) </b>
* **Overview:** LINDDUN is a privacy-focused threat modeling framework that addresses privacy concerns in system design.
* **Application:** It helps identify and mitigate privacy risks, particularly in systems that handle sensitive personal data.
* **Threat Categories:**
* **Linkability:** The ability to link data to an individual.
* **Identifiability:** The ability to identify an individual from the data.
* **Non-repudiation:** The inability to deny one’s actions.
* **Detectability:** The ability to detect the presence of data.
* **Disclosure of Information:** The unauthorized disclosure of data.
* **Unawareness:** Users being unaware of privacy implications.
* **Non-compliance:** Failure to comply with privacy regulations.
* **Use Case:** LINDDUN is particularly useful in applications and systems where privacy is a major concern, such as healthcare, financial services, or any application that processes personal data.

<b> 5. OCTAVE (Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation) </b>
* **Overview:** OCTAVE is a risk assessment and threat modeling framework that focuses on identifying and managing risks at the organizational level. It is divided into three phases: building asset-based threat profiles, identifying infrastructure vulnerabilities, and developing security strategies and plans.
* **Application:** OCTAVE is used by organizations to assess risks from an operational perspective and align security efforts with business goals.
* **Phases:**
* **Phase 1:** Identify critical assets and develop threat profiles.
* **Phase 2:** Identify vulnerabilities related to these assets.
* **Phase 3:** Develop security strategies and mitigation plans.
* **Use Case:** OCTAVE is commonly used in organizations that need a broad, organization-wide risk assessment approach rather than focusing solely on specific technical vulnerabilities.

<b> 6. Attack Tree Model </b>
* **Overview:** Attack trees are a visual representation of the possible ways an attacker could compromise a system. The root of the tree represents the main goal (e.g., gaining unauthorized access), and the branches represent different attack paths.
* **Application:** Attack trees help identify and analyze the various attack vectors and the relationships between different threats.
* **Components:**
* **Root:** The primary objective of the attack.
* **Branches:** Different methods or steps an attacker could take to achieve the objective.
* **Leaf Nodes:** Specific actions or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
* **Use Case:** Attack trees are often used in security assessments to visualize and prioritize potential attack vectors, particularly in complex systems with multiple points of entry.

<b> 7. Kill Chain Model </b>
* **Overview:** Originally developed by Lockheed Martin for military purposes, the Cyber Kill Chain is a model that describes the stages of a cyber attack. It breaks down the attack process into a series of steps, from initial reconnaissance to final data exfiltration.
* **Application:** The Kill Chain model helps defenders understand the progression of an attack and identify opportunities to interrupt or mitigate the attack at different stages.
* **Stages:**
* **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the target.
* **Weaponization:** Creating a malicious payload.
* **Delivery:** Transmitting the payload to the target.
* **Exploitation:** Triggering the payload to exploit a vulnerability.
* **Installation:** Installing malware or backdoors on the target system.
* **Command and Control (C2):** Establishing a communication channel with the compromised system.
* **Actions on Objectives:** Achieving the attacker's goals, such as data theft or disruption.
* **Use Case:** The Kill Chain model is commonly used in incident response and threat hunting to analyze and disrupt attacks at various stages.

<b> 8. MITRE ATT&CK Framework </b>
* **Overview:** MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a knowledge base that categorizes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber adversaries. It is one of the most comprehensive frameworks for understanding and analyzing adversary behavior.
* **Application:** ATT&CK is widely used for threat intelligence, threat hunting, red teaming, and improving defensive capabilities.
* **Components:**
* **Tactics:** The goals or objectives an attacker is trying to achieve (e.g., lateral movement, persistence).
* **Techniques:** The specific methods used to achieve these goals (e.g., phishing, privilege escalation).
* **Procedures:** Detailed descriptions of how attackers implement techniques.
* **Use Case:** Organizations use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to map detected threats to known adversary behaviors, prioritize defense strategies, and improve incident response.

<b> 9. VAST (Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat) Model </b>
* **Overview:** VAST is a threat modeling framework designed to integrate into Agile development processes. It emphasizes simplicity and scalability, allowing for continuous threat modeling throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
* **Application:** VAST focuses on creating actionable threat models that align with both development and operations teams.
* **Components:**
* **Application Threat Models:** Focus on threats related to the application’s architecture and design.
* **Operational Threat Models:** Focus on threats related to the infrastructure and deployment environment.
* **Use Case:** VAST is particularly useful in DevSecOps environments where continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) require agile and ongoing threat assessments.

<b> Conclusion </b>

Each of these threat models has its strengths and is suited to different types of analysis, depending on the organization's needs, the system's architecture, and the specific threats being considered. The choice of threat model(s) should align with the organization's security objectives, risk tolerance, and the nature of the assets being protected. Often, combining multiple threat models provides a more comprehensive understanding of the security landscape.
