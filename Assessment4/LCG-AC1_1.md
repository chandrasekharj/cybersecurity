A cybersecurity incident response plan is a structured, step-by-step approach designed to help organizations detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents, such as data breaches, malware infections, or unauthorized access to systems. It ensures that incidents are handled in a timely, efficient, and effective manner to minimize damage and reduce recovery time and costs.

* **The plan typically includes:**

<b>Preparation </b> – Ensuring the organization has the necessary tools, policies, and personnel in place to handle incidents.

<b>Identification </b> – Detecting and recognizing the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident.

<b>Containment </b> – Limiting the scope and impact of the incident, preventing further damage.

<b>Eradication </b> – Removing the cause of the incident, such as malware or compromised accounts.

<b>Recovery </b>– Restoring affected systems and data to normal operation, ensuring security measures are improved.

<b>Lessons Learned </b>– Conducting a post-incident review to analyze what happened, improve future responses, and prevent recurrence.

Having a cybersecurity incident response plan is essential for protecting an organization's assets, reputation, and compliance with legal or regulatory requirements. It helps reduce downtime and potential losses associated with cybersecurity threats.
